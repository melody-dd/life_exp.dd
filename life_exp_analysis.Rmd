##Life Expectancy Analysis
Loads the data 
```{r}
library(gapminder)
data("gapminder_unfiltered")
gapminder_unfiltered
```

#Caluculate maximum
```{r}
library(dplyr)
gapminder_unfiltered %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  ungroup() ->
  maxdf
maxdf
```
